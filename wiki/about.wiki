== About ==
jQuery.hotkeys is a plugin that let you easily add and remove handlers for keyboard events anywhere in your code supporting almost any key combination.
It is based on a library [http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/keyboard_shortcuts/ shortcut.js] written by [http://www.openjs.com/ Binny V A].

The plugin extends the following jQuery methods and functions:
 * $.fn.bind
 * $.fn.unbind
 * $.find

The syntax is as follows:
{{{ 
$(expression).bind(<types>,<options>, <handler>);
$(expression).unbind(<types>,<options>, <handler>);

$.(document).bind('keydown', 'Ctrl+a', fn);
$.('div.foo').bind('keydown', 
     {combi:'Ctrl+a', disableInInput: true, propogate: true}, fn);

$.('div.foo').unbind('keydown', 'Ctrl+a', fn);

}}}

The default options are:

{{{ 
{ propagate: false, disableInInput: false }
}}}

== jQuery Compatibility==
Tested with *jQuery 1.2.6*

== Browser support ==
||        ||IE 6,7,8||FF 1.5/2/3||Opera-9||Safari-3||Chrome-0.2 ||
||Windows||+||+||+||+||+||
||Mac OS X||x||+||?||+||x||
||GNU/Linux||x||+||?||x||x||

 * + - Works fine.  
 * X - The browser is not available on that platform.  
 * ? - I don't have that browser installed on that platform.

*If you happened to have a browser installed on a platform which I marked as '?', I will appreciate if you kindly run the demo and sends us the results.*

===Note===
Firefox is the most liberal one in the manner of letting you capture all short-cuts even those that are built-in in the browser such as `Ctrl-t` for new tab, or `Ctrl-a` for selecting all text. You can always bubble them up to the browser by using option `propgate:true`.

Others, (IE) either let you handle built-in short cuts, but will add their functionality after your code has executed. Or (Opera/Safari) will *not* pass those events to the DOM at all.

*So, if you add `Ctrl-Q` or `Alt-F4` and your Safari/Opera window is closed don't be surprised.*


===Current Version is: beta 0.0.5===
